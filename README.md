# Simple_Facebook
A very (no really, very) simplified text version of Facebook's most basic functions with Java! Enjoy!

It includes:
- adding a friend
- printing your list of friends
- finding and printing a friend's info
- add a photo and tag a friend
- find how many times a friend got tagged in photos
- find the most tagged user in your friend list
